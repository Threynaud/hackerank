My Hackerrank solutions.

Every solution posted here passed all the test cases with the maximum score. Note that the implementation may not be optimal for certain challenges (eg. use .remove method which is O(n^2) instead of using BST O(nlog(n))) but doesn't impact too much the perfomances of the solutions.
They are written in Python3 for the most part.
You can also find the test cases given as example in the challenges descriptions. 
To test the code, opn your terminal and run the command `cat <TESTS_FILE> | python <PY_FILE>`.
